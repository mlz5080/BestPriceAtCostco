"""
This is a basic script demonstrating the use of OCRmyPDF together with PyMuPDF.

It reads a PDF's pages and passes them to ocrmypdf one by one. One could at this
point insert some checks as to whether the page is actually an, contains no text,
or text with many unrecognized characters or the like.

Each page is then converted to a 1-page temporary PDF which is
- passed to ocrmypdf for OCR-ing it
- the 1-page output PDF of the pervious step is then text-extracted
- return the extracted text

Instead of extracting simple naive text format, one could also use all other
text extraction formats like "dict" to get text position information.
